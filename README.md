+ Project summary: In this project we focus on enhancing fairness in machine learning model through implementation and evaluation of multiple algorithms. Specifically, we explore the local massaging and local preferential sampling algorithms to address and mitigate discrimination in the dataset, thereby effectively promoting more equitable outcomes across different race groups.
