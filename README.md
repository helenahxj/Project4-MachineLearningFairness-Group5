+ Project summary: In this project we focus on enhancing fairness in machine learning model through the implementation and evaluation of multiple algorithms. Our group focuses on two papers that handle discrimination introduced by sensitive attributes: Paper 5 Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer and Paper 6 Handling Conditional Discrimination. Referred to paper 6, we explore the local massaging and local preferential sampling algorithms to address and mitigate discrimination in the dataset, thereby effectively promoting more equitable outcomes across different race groups.
	
**Contribution statement**: Xiangjing is responsible for implementing and evaluating the Local Massaging algorithm, Jiaqi is responsible for the Local Preferential Sampling algorithm in Paper 6, and Boyu and Jitian are responsible for the algorithm in Paper 4.
